	The pinnacle of both art and craftsmanship, originally made to provide companionship for ladies and wealthy women \
	alike. Created to be simply toys or novelty decorations for the wealthy, they do not sleep, eat or bleed. However, \
	due to their dark magic and heretical origin that even their stronger cousin share; They were made to be incredibly \
	brittle as to promote their subservience and remove any chance these somber creations have of killing their masters. \
	Over time, they were seen to prove as valuable asset and advisory role due to their intellectual prowess, it is \
	unknown what provided them with such a gift. A master wanting more engaging conversation? A lord wanting a more \
	efficient clerk? Regardless, who knows what them eyes made of glass truly reflect...<br> \
